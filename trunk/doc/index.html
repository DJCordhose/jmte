<h1>Java Minimal Template Engine</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Java project Minimal Template Engine is meant to fill the gap
between simple string formatting with basic Java classes like
String.format and complex template solutions like Velocity or
StringTemplate.</p>

<p>It is complete but minimal in a sense that you can express
everything you need in a template language including 'if' and 'foreach',
but nothing else. Because of this it is small, easy to learn and clearly
focused. It does not try to solve what Java can do better anyway.</p>

<p>It has no external dependencies, can be extended and configured
in many ways and has barely 1000 lines of code. It runs in almost all
environments including Google App Engine.</p>


<h2>Minimal Template Engine is</h2>
<ul>
	<li><em>minimal</em> - you can express everything who need in a
	template language including if and foreach, but nothing more
	<li><em>non-toy</em> - this is for real stuff
	<li><em>extensible</em> - you can either extend or completely
	replace both internal parsing and error handling
	<li><em>configurable</em> - you do not like ${name}? Simply change
	it to {name} or &lt;name> or whatever you like
	<li><em>flexible</em> - feed in templates as String, Reader, File
	or InputStream - you can also use it as a stand alone tool and feed the
	model in a property file - or use it as a replacement for {@link
	String.format} passing in <code>Object...</code> as model
	<li><em>small</em> - barely 1000 lines of code and no dependencies
	<li><em>simply to learn</em> - it takes less than 5 minutes to
	learn
	<li><em>simply to deploy</em> - no external dependencies and runs
	almost in all environments (including Google App Engine)
	<li><em>fun</em> - you have first class error messages in
	development and robustness in production
	<li><em>robust</em> - it is well tested by a set of JUnit tests
	<li><em>compatible</em> - pass in <code>Map&lt;String,
	Object></code> as model
	<li><em>fast</em> - no time consuming parsing (you can even switch
	off escaping of special characters, making it even faster)
</ul>
