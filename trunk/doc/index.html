<p>The Java project Minimal Template Engine is meant to fill the gap
between simple string formatting with basic Java classes like
String.format and complex template solutions like Velocity or
StringTemplate.</p>

<p>It is complete but minimal in a sense that you can express
everything you need in a template language including 'if' and 'foreach',
but nothing else. Because of this it is small, easy to learn and clearly
focused. It does not try to solve what Java can do better anyway.</p>

<p>It has no external dependencies, can be extended and configured
in many ways and has barely 1000 lines of code. It runs in almost all
environments including Google App Engine.</p>
