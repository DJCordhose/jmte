Release 1.0
===========

First complete public release

Release 2.0
===========

Second complete public release mainly fixing design flaws and providing better API. Template language slightly extended.

*Cleaner lexing allowing for better analysis of templates*
- Lexer now only does the job of a scanner without using evaluation. Evaluation is done on token when needed. 

*New error reporting using properties mechanism*
- We now have i18n error messages that can be formatted with any locale in a lazy style

*More helper functions*
- You can now merge multiple lists into a single one allowing to iterate them in parallel using the engine

*Generally more graceful reactions to expressions that might seem inappropriate*
- If and foreach now try to make sense of any type of object being passed in as an expression parameter
- Even a string expression tries to spit out any kind of object

*Lots of internal refactoring and bug fixing*

*Introduced renderers

*Introduced compiled mode

*Introduced dynamic expressions and a configurable model adaptor
