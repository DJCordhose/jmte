Release 1.0
===========

First complete public release

Release 2.0 rc1
===============

Second complete public release mainly fixing design flaws and providing better API. Template language slightly extended.

*Cleaner lexing allowing for better analysis of templates
- Lexer now only does the job of a scanner without using evaluation. Evaluation is done on token when needed. 

*New error reporting using properties mechanism
- We now have i18n error messages that can be formatted with any locale in a lazy style

*More helper functions
- You can now merge multiple lists into a single one allowing to iterate them in parallel using the engine

*Generally more graceful reactions to expressions that might seem inappropriate
- If and foreach now try to make sense of any type of object being passed in as an expression parameter
- Even a string expression tries to spit out any kind of object

*Lots of internal refactoring and bug fixing

*Introduced renderers

*Introduced compiled mode

*Introduced dynamic expressions and a configurable model adaptor

Release 2.0 rc2
===============

* Samples classes stripped from jars

* Added cached interpreted mode that features speedup close to compiled version (switched on as default)

Release 2.0 rc3
===============

* Cleaned caliper tests

* Fixed source release (missing libs and build files)

* Reintroduced Engine.format as a non-static high performance version

* Fixed infinite loop on certain parsing errors

* Suppressed error messages on stderr when executing tests

* Added a real world example/test

* Added comment token ${-- comment}

* Wrapped all exceptions in Util into RuntimeException

* All renderers and process listener now get the template context as an additional parameter

* Reflection code optimized for performance

Release 2.0 final
=================

no changes from 2.0 rc3

Release 2.1
===========

* Fixed i18n build problem

* Added annotation token ${@ ...}, e.g. for static type declarations

* Engine now thread safe on public methods

* Minor cleaning of API visibilities

* ProcessListener is now passed on a per transformation basis

Release 2.2
===========

* Performance optimizations

* Compiled classes are no longer stored globally and forever, but live as long as the engine - each engine has its own class loader that dies with it

* Now direct access to template is possible as an alternative to the Engine#transform call

* Used variables for interpreted templates are now buffered (have always been buffered for compiled templates)

* Introduced compiler interface "TemplateCompiler"

* Made compiler configurable in Engine allowing for very different compiler implementations even making use of annotations (e.g. for static type information)

* Template now is interface instead of abstract class

* Made all renderer resolvation methods public to be accessible from outside compilers (also added generic parameters)

* Introduced RendererRegistry interface implemented by Engine

* Reverted decision that all renderers get the template context as an additional parameter - now without context again

* Renamed test package "realLive" to "realLife"


Release 3.0
===========

* Engine now holds current version number in #VERSION copied from common.properties

* Engine now supports locale as parameter for transformation that gets passed into TemplateContext for processors and into renderers as an additional parameter - good for locale dependent rendering / processing - breaks public API, though

* NoLogErrorHandler introduced which does does not log, but only throws an exception

* Engine now supports check if variables (expressions) are present in a specific model using #variablesAvailable

* fixed Issue 10: Backslashes in Model data are (incorrectly) removed

* Added Issue 8, fixed Issue 9: add pom.xml to support Maven builds

* fixed Issue 11: Duplicate fields in InterpretedTemplate may cause NPE under some circumstances
  (note: it has impact only in case of some code refactoring)
  
* partially fixed Issue 12: Date Junit Tests fail on different Timezone and/or Locale than MEZ/Germany
  (workaround for CET (Czech) and MET (Germany) Time Zones, but probably fail elsewhere)

Release 3.1
===========

* New Feature: Iteration variable "_it" introduced in foreach loop, e.g. ${foreach list i}${_it}${end} is the same as ${foreach list i}${i}${end}

* New Feature: Introduced new encoder concept that optionally encodes all rendered strings

* Supplied first encoder for XML

* New Feature: Introduced RawRenderer interface that lets renderer be unaffected by configured encoder

* New Feature: Added one-based iteration variable "index_..."in foreach loop, e.g. ${foreach array item \n}${index_item}. ${item}${end}
